* To-Do list for kgdocks

** TODO Isolate mutual services
   + create a bridge network above the compose
     read this : https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34393779/connect-two-instances-of-docker-compose

*** TODO setup haproxy as a common frontend

** TODO fault tolerance on the frontend

   the frontend should be able to have a vhost for the backend, and tolerate
   that backend should be able to fail.

   - should keep the naming of the backend
   - nginx fails when starting with a failed backend, so :
     1) maybe a wrapper should check before how to handle that vhost
     2) upon failure of the backend, send a notification

** TODO replace the arg handling of the compose.sh script
   Already done it a better way on another project, just copy/paste/adapt

** TODO uniformize way of handling app updates
** TODO use env variables in the compose file
   in order to run some "compose apps" multiple times
